    <h1> Bobbie, The Worm off the String</h1>
  <body>
      <p> this is Bobbie! The worm off the string, sometimes bobbie is mistakened as a snake due to his green color. Bobbie is a night owl, he slides around at night and chatters his mouth becuse its cold. Sometimes bobbie likes to dance, but not when it is too cold at night. Bobbie has two eyes that are different colors and no arms, He can grab thngs with his mouth to make up for the lack of hands! Bobbie isn't a mean guy, He is simply a worm off the string. </p>
